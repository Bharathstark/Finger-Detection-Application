# Finger-Detection-Application
I have designed & trained ‘Haar cascade classifier’ for finger  detection using OpenCV 2.4.11.
Developed a C++ console application in visual studio 2013 based on Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection, using Haar-based
cascade classifiers.
Created around 60 cropped positive images of the different fingers, where each with a different rotation, size & background using
Imageclipper and 300 negative samples to train our cascade classifiers.
All negative & positive sample images, which are used to train cascade classifier are saved in imagesamples folder
